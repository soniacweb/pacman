### History
In 1980 the Japanese arcade game manufacturer Namco Limited introduced the world to PacMan. ... The game concept was inspired by food and eating, rather than shooting of space aliens and other foes that prevailed in most arcade games of the time. I was also curious about how one would go about creating it in javascript.
